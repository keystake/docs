# Community Support and Growing Resources

As the Keystake Protocol prepares for its upcoming launch, the community is encouraged to actively contribute to the growth of resources and support channels. This section highlights the collaborative nature of the project and outlines the plans for community-driven resources and support.

#### 1. Collaborative Documentation Efforts

With the launch of the Keystake Protocol, the community will be encouraged to contribute to the creation of comprehensive documentation and FAQs. This collaborative approach ensures that the documentation captures a wide range of insights, use cases, and best practices from diverse perspectives within the community. Participants can actively engage in improving the documentation and enriching it with their experiences, making it a valuable resource for newcomers and experienced users alike.

#### 2. Discord Community Forum

To foster open discussions, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among participants, the Keystake Protocol will establish Discord as its primary community forum. Discord provides a platform for real-time interactions, enabling participants to engage in discussions, seek assistance, and exchange ideas. The community-driven nature of Discord allows participants to connect with like-minded individuals, form relationships, and collectively contribute to the growth and development of the protocol.

#### 3. Twitter for Important Notifications

To stay informed about the latest updates and announcements, participants are encouraged to follow the official Twitter account of the Keystake Protocol. The Twitter account will serve as a central hub for important notifications, including the launch of the Discord community forum, major protocol upgrades, new feature releases, and other noteworthy developments. By following the Twitter account, participants can ensure they receive timely updates and stay engaged with the project's progress.

#### 4. Community-Generated Resources

As the Keystake Protocol progresses, the community will have the opportunity to create additional resources to support participants in their journey. These resources can take the form of tutorials, educational articles, video guides, and other insightful content that adds value to the staking experience. Participants are encouraged to share their knowledge, experiences, and expertise by creating and sharing resources that benefit the broader community.

#### 5. Active Collaboration and Engagement

The success of the Keystake Protocol relies on the active collaboration and engagement of its participants. Community members are invited to actively participate in discussions, provide feedback, ask questions, and share their ideas. By engaging with the community, participants contribute to the collective intelligence and foster an environment of continuous improvement and learning.

### Conclusion

As the Keystake Protocol approaches its launch, the community's involvement is crucial in shaping the project's resources and support ecosystem. Through collaborative documentation efforts, the establishment of Discord as the community forum, the use of Twitter for important notifications, and the creation of community-generated resources, participants play a key role in enhancing the project's knowledge base and support network.

By actively engaging, collaborating, and contributing to the growing resources and support channels, participants can help build a vibrant and inclusive community that empowers individuals to maximize their staking experience with the Keystake Protocol. Follow the official Twitter account for updates on the launch of the Discord community forum and be part of the growing Keystake community. Together, we can shape the future of staking and create a thriving ecosystem for Ethereum holders.
